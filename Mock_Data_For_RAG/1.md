## **Discussion Points**

### **1\. Target Audience Segmentation**

**Miguel:** Our market research has identified four primary segments for initial targeting:

* **Neurocurious Gamers:** Traditional gamers interested in cutting-edge brain science (est. 8.2M addressable market)  
* **Cognitive Enhancement Seekers:** Non-traditional gamers drawn to mental development aspects (est. 12.7M)  
* **Immersive Experience Enthusiasts:** VR early adopters seeking novel experiences (est. 5.4M)  
* **Therapeutic Application Users:** People using gaming for stress relief or cognitive therapy (est. 3.8M)

**Dr. Chen:** I'm concerned we might be overlooking the academic and research community. They could be valuable advocates.

**Aisha:** Agreed. While not a large revenue segment, they provide credibility. Suggest adding them as a fifth target segment.

**Action Items:**

* Miguel to refine audience personas with psychological profiles (Due: March 15\)  
* Olivia to develop platform-specific targeting strategies for each segment (Due: March 20\)  
* Jordan to research academic outreach opportunities (Due: March 18\)

### **2\. Key Messaging and Positioning**

**Sophia:** Our creative team proposes the tagline: "Rewrite Your Reality, Rewire Your Mind"

**Dr. Chen:** I like the neuroplasticity reference, but we should be careful not to overpromise cognitive benefits.

**Miguel:** Market testing shows strong positive response to "mind-enhancing" language, but regulatory concerns are valid.

**Raj:** Community feedback indicates potential users are wary of "brain manipulation" messaging. They respond better to "brain responsive" framing.

**Consensus:** Position Mindweaver as "The first truly responsive neural gaming experience" with emphasis on the game adapting to you, not changing you.

**Action Items:**

* Sophia to refine messaging guidelines with legal review (Due: March 25\)  
* Miguel to prepare positioning statement comparison against competitors (Due: March 12\)  
* Olivia to test revised messaging with focus groups (Due: April 2\)

### **3\. Pre-launch Campaign Roadmap**

**Miguel:** We're planning a three-phase campaign:

* **Phase 1 (April-May):** Scientific intrigue \- teaser content focusing on the neuroscience behind the game  
* **Phase 2 (May-July):** Experience preview \- gameplay footage, developer diaries, limited demos  
* **Phase 3 (July-August):** Community momentum \- beta access competitions, influencer partnerships, countdown events

**Aisha:** This timeline assumes the June 1st beta launch. Engineering has flagged potential delays.

**Dr. Chen:** Let's build flexibility into phases 2 and 3\. We can extend phase 1 if needed without losing momentum.

**Action Items:**

* Miguel to develop contingency plans for timeline adjustments (Due: March 15\)  
* Jordan to create content calendar for Phase 1 (Due: March 22\)  
* Sophia to oversee production of teaser materials (Due: April 5\)

### **4\. Community Building Strategy**

**Raj:** We've identified three community building priorities:

1. Establishing a "Neural Pioneers" program for early advocates  
2. Creating a developer-community feedback loop for beta participants  
3. Building specialized subcommunities around different game aspects (narrative, cognitive challenges, etc.)

**Olivia:** Social listening shows high conversation volume around the cognitive enhancement aspects. Suggest we prioritize that subcommunity.

**Dr. Chen:** The scientific accuracy subcommunity will be critical for credibility. Let's ensure we have neuroscientists and psychologists involved.

**Action Items:**

* Raj to develop Neural Pioneers program structure and benefits (Due: March 30\)  
* Olivia to create subcommunity activation plan (Due: April 10\)  
* Jordan to identify potential scientific community members to recruit (Due: March 28\)

### **5\. Press and Influencer Relations**

**Miguel:** We've segmented our media targets into:

* Gaming publications (IGN, Polygon, etc.)  
* Tech media (Wired, TechCrunch, etc.)  
* Scientific publications (Scientific American, New Scientist, etc.)  
* Mainstream outlets (select technology correspondents)

**Olivia:** For influencers, we're focusing on:

* VR gaming specialists (500K+ combined reach)  
* Neuroscience communicators (3.2M combined reach)  
* Self-improvement/productivity influencers (12M+ combined reach)

**Sophia:** We should include cognitive science academics who have public platforms \- they add significant credibility.

**Action Items:**

* Miguel to finalize press kit with messaging appropriate for each outlet type (Due: April 5\)  
* Olivia to contract 3-5 key influencers for early access content (Due: April 15\)  
* Jordan to develop pitch angles tailored to each media segment (Due: March 25\)

### **6\. Budget Allocation**

**Miguel:** Our $2.8M launch marketing budget preliminary allocation:

* Digital advertising: $1.1M (39%)  
* Influencer partnerships: $650K (23%)  
* Event marketing: $450K (16%)  
* PR activities: $250K (9%)  
* Content production: $350K (13%)

**Dr. Chen:** I'd like to see more allocation toward scientific community engagement and educational content.

**Aisha:** I'm concerned the event budget is high given our digital-first audience.

**Consensus:** Reallocate $100K from events to scientific community engagement and educational content development.

**Action Items:**

* Miguel to revise budget allocation (Due: March 10\)  
* Jordan to research scientific conference opportunities (Due: March 20\)  
* Aisha to approve final budget (Due: March 15\)

## **Key Decisions**

1. Added academic/research community as fifth target segment  
2. Adopted positioning as "The first truly responsive neural gaming experience"  
3. Established flexible three-phase marketing campaign timeline  
4. Prioritized cognitive enhancement and scientific accuracy subcommunities  
5. Reallocated $100K from event marketing to scientific community engagement
