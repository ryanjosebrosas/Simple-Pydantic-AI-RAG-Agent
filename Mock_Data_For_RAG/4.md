# **Neural Data Privacy Framework**

**Version 2.3 \- April 2024**  
 **NeuroVerse Studios Legal & Compliance Team**  
 **Status: Approved by Executive Leadership and Legal Counsel**

## **Document Purpose**

This framework outlines NeuroVerse Studios' approach to neural data privacy, establishing the principles, policies, and procedures governing the collection, processing, storage, and protection of neural and biometric data across all our products and services. It serves as both an internal guideline for our development teams and a transparency document that can be adapted for external communication.

As pioneers in neural-adaptive gaming, we recognize the unique ethical responsibility that comes with processing data related to users' cognitive and emotional states. This framework reflects our commitment to setting the highest industry standards for neural data privacy, exceeding regulatory requirements while enabling the innovative experiences that define our products.

## **Scope**

This framework applies to all neural and biometric data collected through NeuroVerse Studios products, including but not limited to:

* EEG-derived data  
* Eye tracking data  
* Heart rate and heart rate variability  
* Galvanic skin response  
* Facial expression analysis  
* Voice affect analysis  
* Movement and physiological response patterns  
* Derived cognitive and emotional state classifications

It covers the full data lifecycle from collection through processing, storage, use, sharing, and deletion.

## **Guiding Principles**

### **1\. Cognitive Sovereignty**

Users maintain fundamental rights over data related to their neural activity and mental states. This includes rights of access, control, portability, and deletion.

### **2\. Informed Consent**

All neural data collection requires explicit, informed consent based on clear explanations of what data is collected, how it will be used, and the benefits and risks involved.

### **3\. Data Minimization**

We collect only the neural and biometric data necessary to deliver the intended experience, avoiding excessive collection regardless of technical capability.

### **4\. Purpose Limitation**

Neural data is used only for the specific purposes communicated to users at the time of consent, with separate consent required for new purposes.

### **5\. Privacy by Design**

Privacy protections are built into our systems from inception, not added afterward. Our default settings prioritize privacy.

### **6\. Rigorous Security**

Neural data receives our highest security classification, with corresponding controls throughout its lifecycle.

### **7\. Transparency**

We explain our neural data practices in clear, accessible language and provide users with visibility into.
